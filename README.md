#2013-08-n-queens

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
the [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. This project was worked
on with a pair, and as such is representative of the kind of problems that I've
tackled, but not of my solo work.

For a better perspective on my own work, please see [2013-08-n-queens](https://github.com/aevange/2013-08-n-queens.git).
